Visualization of Aircraft Dataset
I recently embarked on a fascinating data analysis project using an Aircraft details dataset I found on Kaggle. This dataset is a goldmine of information, including aircraft manufacturer, country of origin, model, serial number, category, year, and even prices for both new and used aircraft. Armed with the analytical power of Power BI, I dived deep into the data to uncover some intriguing insights.

My first step was to ensure data quality through meticulous cleansing, handling null values, and eliminating extraneous information. Once the data was in pristine shape, I turned my attention to the core questions guiding my analysis.

One burning question was identifying the top aircraft manufacturer based on pricing for both new and used aircraft. To answer this, I applied aggregation and visualization techniques to compare average prices across manufacturers. The results were eye-opening.

But the analysis didn't stop there. I was also keen to explore the dynamic relationship between aircraft age (calculated from the year) and pricing for both new and used aircraft. I employed time-series analysis and calculated measures to provide a comprehensive view of how these variables evolve over time. The findings shed valuable light on pricing trends and temporal variations in aircraft costs.

This project has been an exhilarating journey, deepening my understanding of the dataset while uncovering insights into the world of aircraft details. It's not just about numbers; it's about deciphering trends and patterns that have real-world implications.
